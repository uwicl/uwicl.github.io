            <h2>What is JS?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.</p>
        
            <h2>Key Characteristics and Uses of JavaScript</h2>
            <dl>
                <!-- web interactivity -->
                <dt>Web Interactivity</dt>
                <dd>JavaScript is primarily known for <strong>enabling interactive and dynamic content</strong> on web pages. This includes features like animated graphics, interactive maps, form validation, dynamic content updates, and more.</dd>
                
                <!-- client side scripting -->
                <dt>Client-Side Scripting</dt>
                <dd>Web browsers contain dedicated JavaScript engines that execute the <strong>client-side code</strong>, allowing for manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and interaction with users directly within the browser.</dd>
                
                <!-- multi paradigm -->
                <dt>Multi-Paradigm</dt>
                <dd>JavaScript supports various programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming <em>(using prototypes and classes)</em>.</dd>
                
                <!-- versatility -->
                <dt>Versatility</dt>
                <dd>While most commonly associated with web development, JavaScript can <strong>also be used in non-browser environments</strong> like server-side development with Node.js, desktop applications, mobile applications <em>(with frameworks like React Native)</em>, and more.</dd>
                
                <!-- core concepts -->
                <dt>Core Concepts</dt>
                <dd>It includes fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types (strings, booleans, numbers), operators, functions, control flow (loops, conditionals), and objects.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>In essence, JavaScript empowers developers to <strong>bring dynamic behavior</strong> and rich user experiences to web applications and beyond.</p>
